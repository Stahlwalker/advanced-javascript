## What the project does?
    * This project uses node package managers for inquirer.
    * In the command line after typing node index.js you will be prompted to play the hangman game.
    * This project used 4 js files, an index.js to hold the game, letter.js, words.js and game.js. 

## Why the project is useful?
    * This project is more a less a fun game to play in the terminal rather than how I previously made it in the browser.

    * This is for superhero fans to guess character names. 

## How users can get started with the project?
    * In the command line users can provide the following:
    * 1. node index.js 
    * 2. you will then have 10 letter guesses to guess correctly.
    

## Who maintains and contributes to the project?
    * This project was created for a coding bootcamp and is maintained by the author Luke Stahl
